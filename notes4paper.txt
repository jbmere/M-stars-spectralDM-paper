On the importance of M stars for exoplanetary science.

According to the intro in paper by Rojas-Ayala, Mould 1976 proved the
metallicity sensitivity of TiO bands, and the CaH gravity
dependence. TiO and CaH indicators used to detect low metallicity M
dwarfs.

High metal. M dwarfs are good targets for earth like planet hosts.

Rojas-Ayala propose a series of indicators for K band spectra of
moderate resolution (?: 2700, between 1 and 2.4um) They call them
H2O-K2 NaI and CaI.

IRTF is R~2000 between 0.8 and 2.5, so this is equivalent.
