As for the IRTF spectra, the spectral resolution of the BT-Settl
library was degraded to match the average resolution of the spectra in
the Dwarf
Archives\footnote{http://spider.ipac.caltech.edu/staff/davy/ARCHIVE/index.shtml}. Then,
the spectra were trimmed to produce segments in the spectral range
common to all spectra of M stars in the archive, to avoid missing data
in the input variables. Finally, all spectra were divided by the total
integrated flux in this range in order to factor out the stellar
distance.

There is little hope {\it a priori} for reasonable accuracies with
regression models that predict the surface gravity and metallicity
from such wavelength-limited, low/intermediate resolution
spectra. Anyhow, we provide the results obtained applying the same
methodology as in Section \ref{sec:irtf} (and described in
Section \ref{sec:meth}) to show the limitations.

The application of the GA to the selection of features for the
prediction of effective temperature within the Dwarf Archives
wavelength range and resolution results in the features included in
Table~\ref{tab:ipac-teff-noisy}. Table \ref{tab:ipac-logg-noisy} shows
the spectral features selected for predicting the surface gravity, and
Table~\ref{tab:ipac-met-noisy} those for predicting metallicity.
