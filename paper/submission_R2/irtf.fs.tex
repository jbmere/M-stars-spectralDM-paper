The GAs were applied to the selection of features for the prediction
of effective temperature from both, noiseless and noisy spectra.  For
the IRTF wavelength range and resolution, results in the features have
been included in Table~\ref{tab:irtf-teff-noisy}. Features are
ordered by the fitness value (according to the AIC criterion, as
explained in Eq.~\ref{eq:AIC}) and we only consider features that are
present in at least 5 sets.

Table
\ref{tab:irtf-teff-noisy}
shows a very wide variety of features with very few repetitions. Only
spectral features 4, 5, 6, and 9 in the SNR=50 experiment are found
too in the SNR=$\infty$ and SNR=10 feature sets (albeit with different
continuum definitions). This reinforces the impression that the
information useful for the estimation of the effective temperatures is
spread over the entire IRTF spectrum.

 \caption{Features selected by the GA for predicting $T_{eff}$ using
    noiseless BT\_Settl synthetic spectra in the IRTF wavelength range
    and resolution. The BT\ Settl spectra are plot in a colour scale
    that ranges from blue (2000 K) to red (4100 K). The empty boxes
    correspond to the selected features and the grey boxes to the
    continuum bands.}  \label{fig:IRTF-teff}

For gravity estimation (on a logarithmic scale) and metallicity,
the GA search procedure produces the features presented in Tables
\ref{tab:irtf-logg-noisy} and \ref{tab:irtf-met-noisy}
respectively. Figure \ref{fig:IRTF-teff} shows a graphical
representation of the bands selected for the determination of the
effective temperature superimposed on a set of noiseless BT Settl
spectra.
