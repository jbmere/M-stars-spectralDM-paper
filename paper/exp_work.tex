{
This research, in accordance with the goals depicted in the previous section,
started by considering the collection of M stars provided by
DwarfArchives.org, a compendium of L, M and T dwarfs, 
maintained by Chris Gelino, Davy Kirkpatrick and Adam Burgasser.
}

\subsection{Dataset Selection.}
\label{subsec:DS}
{
The M dwarf database includes around 68 spectra with spectroscopic 
observations obtained at Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea Hawaii, 
with the medium-resolution spectrograph, SpeX, at the NASA. 
The IRTF Spectral Library is a collection of 0.8 $\sim$ 5.0 $\mu$m mostly stellar 
spectra observed at a resolving power of R $\equiv \lambda / \Delta \lambda \sim 2000$.
\cite{2009ApJS..185..289R}. \footnote{Hay una mejor descripci\'{o}n de la librer\'{i}a IRTF en Cesetti et al., 
pero no se si merece la pena copiar su texto aqu\'{i}}
}

{
Features of the library include:
\begin{itemize}
 \item {A spectral range of 0.8 to 2.5 $\mu$m.}
 \item {S/N $\sim 100 $ at $\lambda < 4 \mu$m.}
 \item {Spectral continuum shape is preserved.}
 \item {Absolutely flux calibrated using Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS)  photometry.}
\end{itemize}
}

{
As the goal was to develop a procedure making possible to identify suitable 
reference bands for signal and continuum in this particular class of stars, 
it was decided to use synthetic spectra. We have choosed the library BT-Settl
(\cite{2013MSAIS..24..128A}) where several operations have been performed.
}

\subsection {Reshape of the theoretical library.}
\label{subsec:RTL}
{
Firstly a filterage looking for spectra between 2000 and 4200K was performed over 
the whole BT-Settl dataset, considering log(gravitiy) in range (-4, -6) dex 
with a step of 0.5 dex. Metallicity observed was between 0, -0.5 and -1 dex.
Total size of avaialble spectra is 535 (100K of distance each). 

Spectra degradation from the original 0.1{\AA} stepsize till the required
according to the IRTF resolution factor (R ~ 2000) was accomplished by a gaussian convolution
considering datapoints closer than $\pm 3 \sigma$ , defined because of the $FWHM$ estimation 
depending on the position and R as $ FWHM=2*ln(2)*R $.
Then, the spectra were trimmed to produce valid segments between 8145.924 and 24106.846{\AA}.
}
{
Indeed, in order to become independent of the star\textquoteright s distance 
normalization the area under spectrum has been performed to value of one.
}


{
The authors have conducted also an interpolation procedure to increase the number 
of available learning patterns.
To be sure that interpolation was a valid solution to inferre new synthetic spectra,
a formal destillation of some spectra by using the 
PHOENIX code (\cite{fuhrmeister2005phoenix}) 
was performed and then, compared to the one obtained by interpollating in accordance 
to the inverse square of the distance among the closest neighborgs available 
(see Fig.~\ref{fig:comp_gen_inter}).
}

\begin {figure}

 \caption{Comparison between generated and interpollated spectrum}
 \label{fig:comp_gen_inter}
 \end{center}
\end {figure}

{
Then several other datasets can be created, by defining a mesh of 0.25 dex for 
both, log(gravity) and Metallicity. Temperature step was selected to be 50K, 
which produced 1329 spectra.
Then, another reinterpolation is produced, with a new 
step for temperature of 25K and 0.125 dex for log(gravity), 
keeping the metallicity step in 0.25 dex and producing 
a dataset with 25912 spectra. They can be used as needed for specific 
research pourposes. In spite of these, and in order to keep theirknowledge 
closer to the original BT-Settl source, most of the analyses have been 
performed with the original 535 spectra dataset.
}

{
The synthetic spectra are theoretical and they are noise free but it 
does not happen with real spectra, the IRTF dataset in our case.
To increase similarities gaussian noise have been added with two 
different Signal to Noise Ratio(SNR). The selected SNR were 10 and 50.
}

\subsection{Feature definition}
\label{subsec:FD}
{
It is well known that due to the special characteristics of 
physical parameters for these stars it is not easy to define 
suitable signal bands but it is even more complicated to identify 
the continuum chunks, were no signal shall be expected, because of the 
relative low temperatures they have and its impact on the emission 
rates at different wavelengths.
}

{
There are technical methodologies to identify suitable bands, as the one 
presented in (\cite{2013A&A...549A.129C}). %Cesetti ground base
In that case, bands I and K have been considered. His methodology is
mainly based on the sensitivity exhibited by different spectra through
different regions of the spectra. These observations were carried out by 
visual inspection.
}

{
The approach adopted in this paper was to estimate the three star relevant physical 
parameters ($T_{eff}$, Gravity and Metallicity) establishing a set of features, based on which
regression models could be useful for each of the physical parameters.

As the temperature is considered an strong parameter, it was used as known feature 
for the regression of the Gravity and Metalicity physical parameters.

The central contribution of this paper is the way to identify the most suitable
regions of spectrum (features) to be considered as signal providers 
but mainly the regions to be considered 
as candidates for being continuum for those signal regions.
It will be performed by means of artificial intelligence techniques.

These features consist of
a central bandpass covering the interesting lines and another bandpass
referring to the local continuum. Then, the feature can be written like 
Eq.~\eqref{eq:feature}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:feature}
  F(i) =  \frac{ \int_{\lambda_{1s}(i)}^{\lambda_{2s}(i)} \left(f(\lambda)\right) d{\lambda}}
               { \int_{\lambda_{1c}(i)}^{\lambda_{2c}(i)} \left(f(\lambda)\right) d{\lambda}} 
               \quad \quad \forall i \in [1 \ldots N]
\end{equation}


where:
\begin{itemize}
 \item {N means the number of features to be considered, as decided by the researcher.}
 \item {$f(x)$ denotes the normalized flux spectra from the star.}
 \item {$(\lambda_{1s},\lambda_{2s})$ {\AA} accounts for the region of spectrum where the signal is considered. \quad \label{eq:cons1}}
 \item {$(\lambda_{1c},\lambda_{2c})$ {\AA} accounts for the region of spectrum where the continuum is considered.}
\end{itemize}

{
Now, the research question is how to identify 
$\{\lambda_{1s}(i),\lambda_{2s}(i), \lambda_{1c}(i),\lambda_{2c}(i)\}  \quad \forall i \in [1 \ldots N] $
in such a way they become useful to estimate the physical parameters.

Some constaints were estabished as designing of the selection process:

\begin{itemize}
 \item { $ \vert \lambda_{2k(i)} - \lambda_{1k(i)} \vert = 30 $ pixels of spectrum $ \quad \forall i \in [1 \ldots N]$ and $ k \in \{s,c\} $ .}
 \item { $ min ( \lambda_{1k(i)}, \lambda_{1k(j)} ) = 5 $ pixels of spectrum $ \quad \forall i,j \in [1 \ldots N] $ ; $ i \neq j $ and $ k \in \{s,c\} $ .}
 \item { $ \overline{\lambda_{2}(i)\lambda_{1}(i)}  \bigcap 
                      \overline{\lambda_{2c}(i)\lambda_{1c}(i)} = \emptyset \quad \forall i \in [1 \ldots N]$.}
\end{itemize}

which become a guarantee avoiding any overlap 
and a minimum size for both signal and continuum bandpasses.
}

\subsection{Determination of Features}
\label{subsec:DF}
{
Search for those features will depend on which specific physical parameter is 
under consideration but, the proposed methodology will look for those values 
trying to solve an optimization problem, which shall be the forecast capabilities
of one specific set of features, to be retained when it becomes bigger than 
a threshold.

To accomplish such optimization problem involving the selection of variable 
subsets, the use of the Genetic Algorithms technique was accepted. 
}

{
It was proposed to use the software tools R(\cite{R2013}).
There are different statistics to identify features 
that are differentially expressed between
two or more groups of samples and then uses the most differentially
expressed to construct a statistical model.
}

{
These methods have 
demonstrated to perform well, however, in some cases they can be ineffective
regardless of the classification method used. An obvious conceptual limitation
of univariate approaches is also the lack of consideration that features works in
the contexts of interconnected pathways and therefore it is their behavior as
a group that may be predictive of the phenotypic variables. Multivariate
selection methods may seem to be more suitable for the analysis of 
data since variables are tested in
combination to identify interactions between features. However, the extremely
large number of models that can be constructed from different combination of
thousands of features cannot be extensively evaluated using standard
computational resources.
}

{
For the sake of simplicity let us define 
Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are variable search procedures that are based on
the principle of evolution by natural selection. The procedure works by
evolving sets of variables (chromosomes) that fit certain criteria from an initial
random population via cycles of differential replication, recombination and
mutation of the fittest chromosomes. The concept of using in-silico evolution
for the solution of optimization problems has been introduced by John
Holland in 1975 (\cite{holland1975adaptation}). Although their application has been
reasonably widespread (see Goldberg\textquoteright s 
book (\cite{goldberg1989genetic}), they became
very popular only when sufficiently powerful computers became available.
}

{
The implementation of the GA follows the next steps:
\begin{itemize}
 \item [\textbf{Stage 1}:]{To produce the population of potential features (chromosomes).}
 \item [\textbf{Stage 2}:]{Each chromosome in the population is evaluated for its ability to
predict the group membership of each sample in the dataset (fitness function).}
 \item [\textbf{Stage 3}:]{Chromosome preselection, when a chromosome has 
 a score higher then a predefined value.}
 \item [\textbf{Stage 4}:]{The population of chromosomes is replicated. 
 Chromosomes with a higher fitness score will 
 generate a more numerous offspring.}
 \item [\textbf{Stage 5}:]{The genetic information contained in the replicated parent
chromosomes is combined through genetic crossover. Two randomly selected
parent chromosomes are used to create two new chromosomes.}
 \item [\textbf{Stage 6}:]{Mutations are then introduced in the chromosome randomly. 
 These mutations produce that new genes are used in chromosomes.
 Steps 5 and 6 are applied over the chromosomes establised at Step 4.}
  \item [\textbf{Stage 7}:]{This process is repeated from Stage 2 until 
  enough accuracy is obtained or the maximum of iterations is attained.}
\end{itemize}

The features were built in our case as indicated in \ref{eq:feature} and 
they were named according to the ordinal of the wavelength step both for signal and
continuum. The name includes also the number of ofset induced because of the constraint \ref{eq:cons1}.
Polulation size was choosed as one thousand individuals and accepted iterations were four thousand.
Three randomly started different repetions where produced bringing the opportunity for enough variety
and probabilities were established as 0.85 to corossover and 0.35 to mutation. The elitism was fixed to be 0.15.
Fitness for features were established as related to the Akaike Criterion (-AIC) 
for linearity between the potential feature against the physical parameter.
The most frequent and efficient features were suggeswted as candidates to describe the behavior of specific 
physical parameters. 

From the implementation point of view a binarized codification was selected in accordance to the naming convention
and in order to speed up the computation, a parallel implementation from a farm of fifteen connected computers were used
for each of the physical parameters.
}


{
The GA procedure provides us with a large collection of chromosomes.
Although these are all potential solutions of the problem, it is not clear which one
should be chosen for developing a model becoming for interpretation. 
For this reason there is a need to
develop a single model that is, to some extent, representative of the
population. The simpler strategy to follow is to use the frequency of the chromosme in
the population of chromosomes as criteria for inclusion in a forward selection
strategy, however for this particular applciation, the choice was to include features based on their highest fitness.

After applying this technique the recommended features for temperature 
can be found in Table~\ref{tab:tab_NC_T}.

As in (\cite{2013A&A...549A.129C}) the authors provided their 
best estimation for suitable features, our interest is also to verify how
good it becomes in our particular case, as 
it can be an inderect assessment for the quality of the GA based recommendation. 

As a matter of reference the
