We have cross-referenced this sample against the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) sources, and list data for the detected objects. We discuss stars of individual interest, as well as the characteristics of the overall sample. As expected, a significant number of the stars in this proper-motion-selected sample are halo subdwarfs, including an esdM dwarf, LHS 3481, that is likely to lie within 20 pc of the Sun. None of the subdwarfs show Hα emission.}

	abstract={We present HST ACS observations of 19 nearby M subdwarfs in a search for binary systems. Other than the wide common proper-motion pair LHS 2140/2139, none of our sdM and esdM targets are found to be binaries. Our survey is sensitive to equal-luminosity companions at close (2-8 AU) separations, while substellar secondaries could have been detected at separations in the range of 6-30 AU. To check for wide binaries, we have compared the POSS I and II images in a field of view as large as 10' × 10', but could not detect a single comoving star for any of the targets. Combining our results with those from Gizis & Reid, we have a binary fraction of 3% (1/28). Detection of a small number of M subdwarf binaries reported in the literature suggests a higher fraction than the one obtained here, probably comparable to that found for the more massive solar-type stars in the halo (13%-15%). Comparison with the disk M dwarf fraction (~25%), however, suggests multiplicity to be rare among the lowest mass halo stars, implying the two populations formed under different initial conditions. The low binary fraction in our survey could be explained by selection biases. A decrease in multiplicity has been observed in the disk for masses below 0.1 M ☉ , the peak in the disk mass function (MF). The globular cluster MF is found to peak at about 0.33 M ☉ , with a decrease in the number of stars per unit mass below the peak mass. Our sample being composed of stars with masses between ~0.2 and 0.085 M ☉ suggests that a decrease in multiplicity similar to the disk may also be true for the halo stars, but perhaps below a mass of ~0.3 M ☉ . A higher M subdwarf binary fraction may be obtained if the selected primaries have masses near or higher than the peak in the MF.}

	abstract={The current classification system of M stars on the main sequence distinguishes three metallicity classes (dwarfs: dM; subdwarfs: sdM; and extreme subdwarfs: esdM). The spectroscopic definition of these classes is based on the relative strength of prominent CaH and TiO molecular absorption bands near 7000 Å, as quantified by three spectroscopic indices (CaH2, CaH3, and TiO5). The boundaries between the metallicity classes were initially defined from a relatively small sample of only 79 metal-poor stars (subdwarfs and extreme subdwarfs). We re-examine this classification system in light of our ongoing spectroscopic survey of stars with proper motion μ > 0.45'' yr -1 , which has increased the census of spectroscopically identified metal-poor M stars to over 400 objects. Kinematic separation of disk dwarfs and halo subdwarfs suggest deficiencies in the current classification system. Observations of common proper motion doubles indicates that the current dM/sdM and sdM/esdM boundaries in the [TiO5, CaH2+CaH3] index plane do not follow isometallicity contours, leaving some binaries inappropriately classified as dM+sdM or sdM+esdM. We propose a revision of the classification system based on an empirical calibration of the TiO/CaH ratio for stars of near solar metallicity. We introduce the parameter ζ TiO/CaH , which quantifies the weakening of the TiO band strength due to metallicity effect, with values ranging from ζ TiO/CaH = 1 for stars of near-solar metallicity to ζ TiO/CaH ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/simeq.gif] {simeq} 0 for the most metal-poor (and TiO depleted) subdwarfs. We redefine the metallicity classes based on the value of the parameter ζ TiO/CaH and refine the scheme by introducing an additional class of ultrasubdwarfs (usdM). We introduce sequences of sdM, esdM, and usdM stars to be used as formal classification standards.}

Backtracking this motion allowed us to identify this source as 2MASS J07071961+1705464, with several entries in the USNO B catalog. An astrometric fit to these archival data gives a proper motion of μ = 1793 ± 2 mas yr –1 and a parallax of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/piv.gif] {piv} = 35 ± 42 mas. Photometry from WISE , 2MASS, and the POSS can be fit reasonably well by a blackbody with T = 3658 K and an angular radius of 4.36 × 10 –11 radians. No clear evidence of H 2 collision-induced absorption is seen in the near-infrared. An optical spectrum shows broad deep CaH bands at 638 and 690 nm, broad deep Na D at 598.2 nm, and weak or absent TiO, indicating that this source is an ultra-subdwarf M star with a radial velocity v rad ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} –21 ± 18 km s –1 relative to the Sun. Given its apparent magnitude, the distance is about 39 ± 9 pc and the tangential velocity is probably ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {≈} 330 km s –1 , but a more precise parallax is needed to be certain.}
