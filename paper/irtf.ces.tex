For metallicities, we again find that the only feature space that
results in reasonable results is based on ICA projections and
SNR=10. Comparison of the correlation coefficients of the various
regression results with the literature values shows no significant
difference between the GA-based features and those taken from
\cite{cesetti}. Therefore, neither set is competitive with the ICA
projections. In Fig. \ref{fig:irtf-ces-met} we show the results of the
regression technique that results in the highest correlation with the
literature values (RF-50).
