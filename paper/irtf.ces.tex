For metallicities, we again find that the only feature space that results in reasonable results is based on ICA projections and SNR=10. Comparison of the correlation coefficients of the various regression results with the literature values shows no significant difference between the GA-based features and those taken from \cite{cesetti}. Therefore, neither set is competitive with the ICA projections. In Fig. \ref{irtf-cs-met} we show the results of the regression technique that results in the highest correlation with the literature values (RF-50).
